This is an exploratory analysis of data from marks secured by the students in high school from the United States.

After analysing the results, it is possible to draw some conclusions:

Genre:
- Analysing gender, it can be concluded that males scored higher in maths and females scored higher in reading and writing. Below is a comparison of the score averages. The medians are above the means, which further corroborates the result.
- math score - mean:
   male = 68.72
   female = 63.63
- reading score - mean:
   male = 65.47
   female = 72.60
- writing score - mean:
   male = 63.31
   female = 72.46

Parental level of education:
- This is an important fact to take into account since all three tests have the same pattern of results.
- with the median as a reference, the two types of parental level of education that generated the best results were master's degrees and bachelor's degrees.On the other hand, those who performed worst in the tests were those whose parents were educated to high school level.

Lunch:
- In terms of lunch, those who opted for the standard lunch far outperformed those who opted for the free/reduced lunch. - Analysing both the average and the median confirms this.
- math score - mean:           median:
   free/reduced = 58.92        free/reduced = 58.92
   standard = 70.03            standard = 70.03

- reading score mean:          median:
   free/reduced = 64.65        free/reduced = 65.00
   standard = 71.65            standard = 72.00

- writing score mean:          median:
   free/reduced = 63.02        free/reduced = 64.00
   standard = 70.82            standard = 72.00

Test preparation course:
- When comparing those who took the preparation course with those who did not, the results are very impressive. Those who took the course did much better than those who did not take the course.
- It is possible to check this with the mean and median.

- math score - mean:           median:
   completed = 69.69        completed = 69.00	
   none = 64.07             none = 64.00

- reading score mean:          median:
   completed = 73.89        completed = 75.00
   none = 66.53             none = 67.00

- writing score mean:          median:
   completed = 74.41        completed = 76.00
   none = 64.50             none = 65.00

 
- Another interesting result in relation to the scores is that when the results are compared with each other, the higher the grade in one test, the higher it is in the others. In general, as one grade is high, the others tend to be as well. The reverse is true.

Conclusion:

- Parents' level of education can affect students' performance, but it is not the most important thing. Finalising the preparatory course and opting for the standard lunch are the most important points.

- Gender has no correlation with the score.

- In short, for students to do well in the exam they need to eat well and prepare for the exam.
